# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built with React. 
It features a 3x3 grid where players can take turns clicking on squares to place their mark (either "X" or "O"). 
The game tracks the current player and displays a message indicating who is next. 
It also checks for a winner and displays a message when a player wins or when the game ends in a tie.

This is an assignment I completed as part of the Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN program at MIT. 
The assignment involved building a Tic Tac Toe game using React and implementing various features such as tracking the current player, 
checking for a winner and adding a restart button. 
I am adding this project to my GitHub repository to showcase my skills in front-end web development with React.

# Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:
git clone https://github.com/Lizsei/tic-tac-toe.git
cd tic-tac-toe
npm install

Then, start the development server:
npm start

This will start the development server at http://localhost:3000.

# Dependencies

This project was built using:

React (v17.0.2)
React DOM (v17.0.2)
React Scripts (v4.0.3)

# Roadmap of Future Improvements
A few of the features Iâ€™d add to make the game more fun and engaging:

Add a timed mode, where players only have a certain amount of time to make their moves.

Add animation to the game when a player wins or when a square is clicked. Which would also make it more visually appealing.

Add a leaderboard showing the top players and their scores.
